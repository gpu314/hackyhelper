# üèÜ¬†Sponsor Prizes

## OTPP

Most innovative hack using AI by a first-timer hacker, Prize: connect with a senior leader from our Enterprise Operations/Product Engineering teams.

*‚ÄúThe¬†**Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan Board**¬†is an independent organization responsible for administering¬†defined-benefit pensions¬†for school teachers of the¬†Canadian province¬†of¬†Ontario. Ontario Teachers' also invests the plan's¬†pension fund¬†and it is one of the world's largest¬†institutional investors, acting as a partner organization of the¬†World Economic Forum. The plan is a multi-employer pension plan, jointly sponsored by the¬†Government of Ontario¬†and the¬†Ontario Teachers' Federation.‚Äù*

**Prize**: Coffee Chat!

## **WARP ‚Äì  Best Developer Tool by Warp**

Build a hack that focuses on improving the developer experience in some meaningful way - this could be tackling any part of the development lifecycle (creating, modifying or testing software)!

No API requirements for this prize! You do not need to use Warp.

*‚ÄúThe command line is both incredibly powerful and annoyingly hard to use. Master it and gain super-powers: from controlling your cloud systems, to manipulating local files and programs, writing quick workflows and more...it's a developer's swiss-army knife. Despite its power, it's a very hard tool to master. It has a notoriously steep learning curve - it doesn't work like other tools, nothing in it helps you learn how to use it well, it's very easy to make destructive mistakes, and so on. Many developers avoid it for these reasons. But for those who do learn how to use it well, they become much better at development and devops. Mastering the CLI lets you work faster with your existing tools, and increases their power because a keyboard driven, repl-style interface has many advantages over GUIs.*

*At Warp, our goal is to re-create the command line as a modern app, making a more usable, humane and, ultimately, more powerful CLI for everyone.‚Äù*

**Prize**: Keychron keyboards for each member of the team.
